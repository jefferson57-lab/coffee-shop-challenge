# ☕ Coffee Shop Challenge

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Challenge! This is a fun and simple Python project that models the relationships between **customers**, **coffee drinks**, and **orders** at a coffee shop using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 🧠 What’s This About?

The idea is to simulate a real-world coffee shop where:
- Customers can place multiple orders.
- Orders are linked to both customers and coffees.
- We can track things like:
  - How many times a coffee has been ordered.
  - Who the top coffee lover (aka "most aficionado") is.
  - The average price people paid for a specific drink.

This project is a great way to practice object relationships, class-level behavior, and clean Python design.
